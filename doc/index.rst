Content wanted
--------------

It would be nice to include in the documentation the following information:

- pylint plugins (how to write one, how to install a 3rd party plugin, how to
  configure Pylint to run it)

- pylint brain project : what it is, how to install it...

Please send your pull requests via bitbucket if you can help with the above.
