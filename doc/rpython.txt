Since 0.17, pylint contains a Restricted python checker (rpython). 
It contains the following checks:

* unavailable keywords / builtins
* multiple inheritance
* mixing multiple types
* non homogeneous list
* global modification
* negative slice index
* using %r in format string
* warn about special methods that are not implicitly called

By default the rpython checker is deactivated. Activate it using :

  pylint --rpython-mode -rn ...

(-rn is disabling statistics reports) or

  pylint --enable-checker=rpython ...

to get only rpython checks (though in this case you won't be warned about
regular errors).

Another interesting thing is the rpython dedicated testing framework,
testing that checked things are actually not translatable. I have the idea
that this may be useful to generate some kind of documentation for
features supported by rpython or not, and help spread information when a
feature that wasn't supported is introduced in rpython. That's another
story though... If you're interested, check
pylint/test/test_rpycompilation.py.
