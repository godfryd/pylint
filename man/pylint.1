.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pylint 
is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming
errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code
smells (as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book)

Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you
can do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. However, Pylint
offers some more features, like checking length of lines of code,
checking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding
standard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented,
and much more.

Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--version"
show program's version number and exit
.IP "--help, -h"
show this help message and exit

.SH MASTER
.IP "--rcfile=<file>"

.IP "--errors-only, -e"
In debug mode, checkers without error messages are disabled and for others, only the ERROR messages are displayed, and no reports are done by default
.IP "--profile=<y_or_n>"
Profiled execution.
.IP "--ignore=<file>"
Add <file or directory> to the black list. It should be a base name, not a path. You may set this option multiple times.

Pickle collected data for later comparisons.
.IP "--cache-size=<size>"

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables are used :                                 
    * PYLINTHOME                                                               
    path to the directory where data of persistent run will be stored. If not
found, it defaults to ~/.pylint.d/ or .pylint.d (in the current working
directory) . The current PYLINTHOME is /home/adim/.pylint.d.                    
    * PYLINTRC                                                                 
    path to the configuration file. If not found, it will use the first        
existant file in ~/.pylintrc, /etc/pylintrc. The current PYLINTRC is
None.                                                                 


.SH OUTPUT

Using the default text output, the message format is :                         
        MESSAGE_TYPE: LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE

    * (C) convention, for programming standard violation                       
    * (R) refactor, for bad code smell                                         
    * (W) warning, for python specific problems                                
    * (E) error, for much probably bugs in the code                                                
    * (F) fatal, if an error occured which prevented pylint from doing further processing.
